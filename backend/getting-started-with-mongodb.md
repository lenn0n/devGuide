### MongoDB Crash Course

### Installation
- Download MongoDB Community

      https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community

- Download MongoDB Shell (MongoSH)

      https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell

Install the MongoDB in your system and you will get **MongoDB Compass**.

Next, extract the mongo shell you have downloaded from above and add the executable file in your system **environmental variables**. I am using windows so the step in Linux might be different.
