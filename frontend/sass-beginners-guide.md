# SASS
SASS stands for Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets and is a pre-processor scripting language that extends CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). 
SASS code is processed by a program and compiled into CSS code, which can then be used to style HTML elements and control how a page appears on the web.

### Installation
>        npm install -g sass

### Usage or put in the package.json script
>        sass --watch input.scss output.css
>        "build:scss": "sass --watch input.scss output.css"

Now in your terminal, run *npm run build:scss* script.

### Variables
Think of variables as a way to store information that you want to reuse throughout your stylesheet. 
You can store things like colors, font stacks, or any CSS value you think youâ€™ll want to reuse. Sass uses the $ symbol to make something a variable. Hereâ€™s an example:
>        
        $font-stack: Helvetica, sans-serif;
        $primary-color: #333;
        
        body {
          font: 100% $font-stack;
          color: $primary-color;
        }

### Nesting 
Sass will let you nest your CSS selectors in a way that follows the same visual hierarchy of your HTML. 
Be aware that overly nested rules will result in over-qualified CSS that could prove hard to maintain and is generally considered bad practice.
>        
    nav {
      ul {
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
        list-style: none;
      }
    
      li { display: inline-block; }
    
      a {
        display: block;
        padding: 6px 12px;
        text-decoration: none;
      }
    }

once compiled, it will become like this in css output.

      nav ul {
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
        list-style: none;
      }
      nav li {
        display: inline-block;
      }
      nav a {
        display: block;
        padding: 6px 12px;
        text-decoration: none;
      }

### Exluding scss file from building
You can exclude scss file from building by adding prefix undescore (_) in the filename of your class.

variables.scss > _variables.scss
