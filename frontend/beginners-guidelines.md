## MVC vs MVT

### ![#c5f015](https://placehold.co/15x15/c5f015/c5f015.png) MVC
Model - represents your data or structure

View - the GUI to represents data

Controller - logic and handling interactions between Model and View.

### ![#c5f015](https://placehold.co/15x15/c5f015/c5f015.png) MVT
Model - represents data or structure

View - handles user requests and return responses

Template - the interface


One of the most significant differences lies in how user interactions are managed. 
In MVT, the Template is mainly for presentation, while the View handles data and user interactions. In MVC, the Controller is responsible for handling user interactions and updating the Model, which in turn updates the View.

Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can use the web equally.
- Someone who cannot hear well so they use captions
- Someone who canot see well so they use screen readers
- Good color contrast
- Age-related impairement, reducing dexterity
- Good layout designs

## ![#c5f015](https://placehold.co/15x15/c5f015/c5f015.png) 4 core principles:
1. Perceivable - for example, people can see the content or hear it.
2. Operable - for example, people can use the compute by typing or by voice.
3. Understandable - for example, people get clear and simple language.
4. Robust - for example, people can use assistive technologies.

Implementing accessibility standards is essential for people with disabilities.

## ![#c5f015](https://placehold.co/15x15/c5f015/c5f015.png) Library Vs. Framework
Both are pre-written code to speed up the development.

Library is a set of code that can be called inside of our application.

Framework is a supporting structure or a guide for building application.
