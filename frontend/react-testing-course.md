### Why you should test?
The primary goal is to check whether the application behaves as expected. Giving you a lot of confidence and produce high quality features.

Unit testing - testing a very small part of the code.
Integration testing - test for a group of components that interacts with each other.
End-to-End Testing - frontend to backend testing.
